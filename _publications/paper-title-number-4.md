A well-trained deep neural network on balanced datasets usually exhibits the Neural Collapse (NC) phenomenon, which is an informative indicator of the model achieving good performance. However, NC is usually hard to be achieved for a model trained on long-tailed datasets, leading to the deteriorated performance of test data. This work aims to induce the NC phenomenon in imbalanced learning from the perspective of distribution matching. By enforcing the distribution of last-layer representations to align the ideal distribution of the ETF structure, we develop a Distribution Alignment Optimization (DisA) loss, acting as a plug-and-play method can be combined with most of the existing long-tailed methods, we further instantiate it to the cases of fixing classifier and learning classifier. The extensive experiments show the effectiveness of DisA, providing a promising solution to the imbalanced issue.
