I am a full-time doctoral student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University, enrolled in the class of 2023.

Iâ€™m interested in imbalanced learning, optimal transport, and interpretation of machine/deep learning in the deep learning context.

Address: Jilin University, Changchun, China
